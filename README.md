> What is metagenomics and why is it important?

Think about it: a small microbial sample from a human can tell you so many things about them. Isn't that pretty dope? These samples typically come in large dumps of nucleotide sequences. Many (bioinformatics) pipelines exist to process and analyse these in bulk, and, they're only getting progressively better. We can do so much: from understanding [why corals naturally bleach](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1758-2229.2010.00234.x) to [synthesising medicine through antibiotic agents extracted from the microbes](https://www.scielo.br/j/bjm/a/DNd6nKWKNrT9CFtTLYr3Nwr/?lang=en&format=html).

> What is the current focus of these studies?

Pipelines, as mentioned, have room to grow. Its recent integration with AI has been impactful to improving its efficiency and scope. A few more papers down the line and who knows what more we can infer from the samples.

Also, there are microorganisms literally everywhere. Literature tells us what to expect from them, but there are many interactions between the many microbes in many different systems. Looking into how these systems change with their microbiome can help us prevent problems (e.g. biodegredation) and make important diagnoses.
